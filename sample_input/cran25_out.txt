ID: 50 Title: investigation of laminar boundary layer in compressible fluids using the crocco method .
  in the present investigation of the flow of air in a thin laminar boundary layer on a flat plate, the crocco method has been used to solve the simultaneous differential equations of momentum and energy involved in such flow .  the crocco method was used because it gave accurate results for arbitrary prandtl number near unity .  the prandtl number was taken at 0.75, the specific heat was held constant, and the sutherland law of viscosity-temperature variation was assumed to represent the viscosity data starting with an initial ambient temperature of -67.6 f .  the main results presented here are the skin-friction and heat-transfer coefficients as functions of reynolds number, mach number, and wall-to-free-stream temperature ratio .  variations of shear, velocity, temperature, and mach number across the boundary layer are included .  the crocco method is discussed in detail .
